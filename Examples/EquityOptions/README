Scenario:
---------

DataPublisher publishes indicative and market data information for 20 put and call strikes for three stock tickers.
Three calculators(EquityOptionServers) subscribe to indicative and market data for a given stock ticker.
They compute NPVs and Greeks on puts and calls of received strikes and publish results to clients.
Two clients receive data published by 3 calculators and display the results.
This example also demonstrates the multi-topic subscription feature of OpenDDS by having sequences of BlackContantVols, GeneralizedBlackScholesProcesses, StickedTypePayoffs and EuropeanExcercises published by the DataPublisher joined on the ticker by the EquityOptionServer.
